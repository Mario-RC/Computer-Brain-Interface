## Computer-Brain Interface

The proposed work consists of a succinct review of the state of the art, in addition to performing the basic analyses to build a brain-computer interface (BCI).

It is recommended to read previously the two recent review articles (Bensmaia and Miller, 2014; Pandarinath et al., 2018) (note that the second one is based on more advanced techniques).

This paper "explores" data from intracortical records of a macaque performing a motor task. These data are used to program a decoder that predicts hand movement based on the activity of ~100 neurons of the primary motor cortex.
